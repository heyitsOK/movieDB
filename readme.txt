Initializing/Running Server:
    Start by running the database-initializer.js script using the command "node databse-initializer.js". Wait until "Finished" 
    is logged Install modules using command "npm install". Once database has been initialized and modules have been installed, 
    start the server: "node ./server.js". Now that server has started the website is accessible at "http://localhost:3000/"
